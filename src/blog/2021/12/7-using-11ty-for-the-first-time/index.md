excerpt: The everlasting battle of redesigning my personal website is getting really out of hand. Over the past few years I tried a lot of different approaches but none of them seemed to workâ€”until now

I think one of the earliest versions of my website was back in 2009, that's already over 10 years ago. Holy... Since then a lot has changed and I have redesigned this page countless times. So many different designs, blog posts, tools and systems that I have used, it's crazy. One thing that never changed was the domain though&mdash;[myxotod.de](http://myxotod.de). (update: oops, now this changed too)

In the very beginning my website only consisted of static HTML files, no preprocessors, no logic code, nothing but HTML and CSS. As I continued to learn new languages and technology advanced I concidered using other tools that make my website more maintainable and more *fun* to work with.

For a very long time I have used [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) as a static website creation tool or even built my sites bare bones without any other tools except SASS and maybe Coffeescript. Every now and then I even included some PHP. Now, for the first time, I'm using [11ty](https://11ty.dev) and it is super fun to play around with. Well actually it is not *really* the first time using 11ty but at least it is the first use of it that you can actually see. This page has also countless ancestors before I got to this layout.

It feels like pulling out a very old book from the shelf and blowing away a big layer of dust into a distance. Finally a website again that actually delivers *content* and triggers the urge for me to maintain it regularly. I'm excited to continue working with 11ty and improving this layout (maybe even some light/dark theming). Also creating some 11ty-plugins along the way would be really interesting. If this happens I will let you know on my [projects](/projects/) page. (this page is still in the planning phase at the time of writing this post)

For now feel free to wander around and enjoy the depths of this personal website/blog. ðŸ˜Žâœ¨

Not a lot going on here recently so I thought I would give an update of what’s in the pipeline. I’ve been working on a redesign of makkusu.dev for quite a while now. It’s not a big deal but takes longer than expected because I lack free time or spend it relaxing instead. I wanted to deploy the new version before heading back to Japan at the end of October 2025 but since this won’t be happening I’m writing this post to give a general update about me, my life, this website and whatever else is on my mind right now.

## Redesign of makkusu.dev

As mentioned above, the redesign is nothing too special but I wanted to do this for a long time now. It includes a major update of 11ty, the static site generator I’m using, as well as a design overhaul and a new page structure. I noticed that this website feels quite “empty” even though I had big plans for it and a lot to share. I want to include many more sub pages about different topics that are related to my life, my workflows, my hobbies and so on.

I clicked through a lot of personal websites and repositories during the last few months that I discovered in various webrings to find motivation and inspiration. Shiver me timbers, do you guys have cool websites, damn. Not much more to say about this as of now but I will keep you updated and hopefully release soon after I come back from my vacation.

## Japan Round 3

Speaking of vacation, I’m heading back to Tokyo in about 2 weeks from now and I’m so excited! I didn't think I would be able to go this year but certain events this year lead to the possibility of being able to (yay!).

Last year I was really lucky to go there twice, in April and October. In April I spent time in Tokyo, Kyoto and Osaka. During my stay at the end of October and beginning of November I mainly stayed in Tokyo but also spent some time in Kamakura and next to Mt. Fuji, in Fujiyoshida. I also spent Halloween in Shibuya.

As some of you know I’m also writing a longer blog post about my trips last year. This will probably take some more time, sorry.

The upcoming trip will be to Tokyo and apart from that I plan to make a one or two day trip to the island named “Niijima” south east of Tokyo in the pacific ocean. Can’t wait!

## What else is happening

Not much to be honest. I’m trying to spend more focus and “me”-time to get my life back together after having a little bit of an emotionally roller coaster ride at the end of last and the first half of this year. Struggled with some personal situations but feeling a lot better now thankfully. I can’t stress enough how important it is to be there for yourself and do what makes you happy to escape darker times in life. Remember, this is most likely a long process and not a race with a finish line.

Coming back to the brighter things in life, I resumed studying Japanese after not having enough time and motivation due to previously stated situations. I still feel kind of stuck at my current level but that’s okay and I’m happy for any progress in the future. Meeting Japanese friends more regularly now and trying to consume more Japanese content online, such as podcasts, vlogs and listening comprehension. Getting better step by step.

Another great thing I want to share is my progress in terms of web development. Since I started work at my current company I gained a lot of new experiences. This also sparked interest in various topics for private projects, such as this website and others. I wrapped this website in a docker container and put it all together with automatic deployment on my server.

Also working on a new project which is fully dockerized, using Angular as the frontend and Express as the backend. I’m super hyped about my current tech stack. I really can’t think of why I wasn’t using Docker or similar tools for such a long time, I’ve been missing out on something.

I'll keep you updated about my trip to Japan and everything else in the near future ✌🏼

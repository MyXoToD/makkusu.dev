I created this 11ty plugin to display the reading time of my blog posts and other content fragments. It's no where near perfect and needs a lot of refactoring but for now I'm happy as it is. It was also the first npm package I published ever.

You can find the code [on github](https://github.com/MyXoToD/eleventy-plugin-readingtime) and the package itself [on npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@myxotod/eleventy-plugin-readingtime).

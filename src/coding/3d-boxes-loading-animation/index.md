excerpt: I was playing around with 3D boxes when I came up with this little loading animation.

I stumbled upon [this pen by Amit Sheen](https://codepen.io/amit_sheen/pen/JjzGGQR) and thought it was a really cool idea. I wanted to create something similar and maybe more towards a loading animation&mdash;something a little more subtle (if you can still use that word when animating 3D boxes tbh).

This is was I came up with, an infinite loop of moving 3D boxes.

When I was in 7th grade I had the opportunity to attend a 2 week class for learning the basics of HTML and even a little bit of CSS. After this class ended I was extremly hooked with the whole topic and wanted to continue learning. In my free time I continued improving my HTML skills and learned how to write CSS, PHP and MySQL-Queries.

The revolution of this website is the result of this. I might include some screenshots of former version in the future. I love crafting web-apps to this day and I even managed to make this my job after I graduated school.

Every now and then I enjoyed playing chess but I never really took the time to get a deeper understanding of what I am doing and what I should be doing. Chess seems simple at first but can become quite complex. In summer of 2023 I started playing more regularly and tried to improve my moves. I made friends with other chess players, we're looking forward to hosting some public chess games in the future. I'll let you know here.

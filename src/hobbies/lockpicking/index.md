There's not much to say about this hobby other than the story how I got to it. It is very rare that I lose or forget some thing, but it still happens. Unfortunately it was my apartment keys. I paid way to much to get my door opened, so I decided to learn lock picking to do it myself if I ever lock myself outside again.

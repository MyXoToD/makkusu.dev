I've always loved magic, no matter what kind. Watching the great magicians on TV as a child always made me smile in awe. In school I bought my first deck of poker cards and performed my very first card tricks for friends. I couldn't get enough, each trick I saw someone do made me want to learn how it is done.

I spent countless days and nights perfecting sleight of hand moves and it never got boring to me. To this day I enjoy bringing my cards wherever I go to bring joy to the people. I makes me happy to be able to make people forget the moment they are in, it's amazing to me.

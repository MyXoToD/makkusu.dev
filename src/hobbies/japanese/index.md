In October 2020 I decided to start learning Japanese. I started by learning <span class="tooltip" data-text="2 of the 3 writing systems in the Japanese language">Hiragana & Katakana</span>, then continued with several apps, websites, videos and a private teacher. After a while I felt the need to visit a language school with helped tremendously. I was able to pass the <span class="tooltip" data-text="The Japanese language proficiency test">JLPT N5</span> test in early summer 2023 in DÃ¼sseldorf. After that I continued on my own again.

I think I could have achieved much more progress in that time but for me it feels better learning at a slow pace. Currently I focusing on improving my vocabulary and studying new kanji. This section will be updated in the future to give you a better insight of how I learn and what I use. For now I can only recommend using Anki, no matter what you want to learn.

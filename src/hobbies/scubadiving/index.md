In summer 2019 I went diving for the first time and shortly after I decided to do my very own licence. I went to a diving school in Wiesbaden and was able to get my <span class="tooltip" data-text="Permission to dive anywhere in the world up to 18m/60ft depth">PADI Open Water Diver Certification</span>. Unfortunately I'm mostly diving indoors. There are really cool indoor diving locations in Germany but to be able to go diving in the ocean is still on my bucket list. The only time I went diving outside was to get my certification done.

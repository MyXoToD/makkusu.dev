In late 2023 I went to a boulder gym close to where I live. A friend of mine took me there and showed me the basics. What can I say&mdash;I was hooked immediately. 3 weeks later I was going to the gym at least 1 or 2 times a week, bought myself some basic equipment and eversince I love going there and improve my skills. It's one of the best sports activities I have ever done, it trains the whole body, is simple to learn and is fun to do!

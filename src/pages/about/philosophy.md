<h1 class="page-title" data-kanji="ルール">Philosophy & Rules</h1>

This page is a collection of rules, values and philosophies I strive for. I don&rsquo;t follow each of them precisly
but I very much aim towards it. Some can be followed with ease, others can be quite a challenge. Sometimes it can also be very difficult to put values into words. My goal is to become a better or the best version of myself.

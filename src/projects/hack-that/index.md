# Hack That

When I was 15 I started my first internship at a web-agency and soon after I would start my apprenticeship at the very same company. During that time I upped my HTML and CSS skills but also gathered new knowledge about PHP, MySQL and Javascript in various client projects. Didn't take long until I thought about my own projects apart from my website&mdash;it was the only &ldquo;project&rdquo; I was running back then.

browser games were still a big thing in 2009 and I was one of the people enjoying them. After contributing to a hacker-RPG kind of browser game I was hooked on creating my own game like this, this is how hack-that came to life.

It was a huge challenge for me to start something so big. I didn't even know how to set up everything and get started. So much to plan, so much to do. There were no excuses, so I kept going. Every evening, every night I was coding the website and planning new features alongside. <span class="tooltip" data-text="Object-oriented programming">OOP</span> was still very new to me because I only recently started learning about PHP and my only success so far was a guesbook on my personal website that would store and read entries to and from the MySQL database.

After creating the first few classes I got the hang of it and work became easier. I continued for around one year and was finally able to publish the game. I did run a closed beta version to test everything with a couple of friends and after that I was very happy and pleased to finally throw it out into public.

The game had 100-200 active players during the best times and most of the time received good feedback. After a while I added some more features but also realised how bad the code quality really was. My skills got better over time and my feelings about hack-that's quality was getting worse. I still loved this project and I still do but at some point I decided to shut it down and say farewell.

I was sure that there are more games to follow after this one. Good lessons learned and improved my live a lot with this project.

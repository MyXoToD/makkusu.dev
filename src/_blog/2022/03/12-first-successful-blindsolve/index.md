excerpt: After over 10 years of speedcubing I finally decided to give it a try to perform a blindsolve. After a few days I was finally able to do it. Here's how I got there.

**tl;dr**&mdash;*I did it. It took me about 4 days of practice and the solve was just above 10 minutes. Check out the [video below](#video)*

Those of you who know me in person, know that I've been doing speedcubing for over 10 years already. I don't really remember when I really started but I know that my first official competition was 2011 in the Netherlands. Here's a [video from said competition](https://youtu.be/DLfM8VXO-GM)&mdash;my first official personal best time. (btw I absolutely loved that purple tattoed Darth Vader shirt)

As you can see I was super excited, super happy, had a very lucky <span class="tooltip" data-text="A lucky coincidence in which you don't need to do the last step of the CFOP system">PLL skip</span> and *I did not have a beard*. The last one being the most weird of it all.
After competing in many more competitions, beating my personal best countless times and even going the [Las Vegas for the world championship in 2013](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcIvwpm4PIc) it was now finally time to learn how to solve this damn puzzle blindfoled.

During my *active* years in the speedcubing community, between 2011 and 2014, I picked up many information on how to actually solve the standard 3x3 cube blindfolded but I never really tried to do it. I thought it would be too hard or too time consuming to learn a good and reliable memorization technique. Although I did solve the cube with eyes open, only using moves that would be used when solving it while eyes are closed (T-Perm, J-Perm and Y-Perm&mdash;together with some setup moves).

That's right, you basically only need the T- & Y-Permutation to solve a 3x3 Rubik's Cube blindfolded. But to be more precice and to also make it a little bit more convenient this is what you need:

- T-Perm: `R U R' U' R' F R2 U' R' U' R U R' F'`
- J-Perm: `R U R' F' R U R' U' R' F R2 U' R' U'`
- Y-Perm: `F R U' R' U' R U R' F' R U R' U' R' F R F'`
- Y-Perm variation: `R U' R' U' R U R' F' R U R' U' R' F R`
- R-Perm (Party-Algorithm): `L U2' L' U2' L F' L' U' L U L F L2' U`
- A lot of setup moves: Intuitive
- A good memorization technique: [Old Pochmann](https://www.speedsolving.com/wiki/index.php/Classic_Pochmann)

So now it was time for me to check the last point on this list. The memorization. After some research I found some pictures that are actually describing the procedure so easy I didn't have to do any more research but practice.

This is my own creation of the images that I found. Every corner and every edge has a letter assigned to it from A to X, fortunately you don't need to remember Y and Z (that would be too much, honestly &lt;/irony&gt;).

But how does it work? A quick description of how to remember the edge pieces. Holding the cube as pictured above: I start by looking at piece *B/M*, checking the *B*-sided color of it. Then <!-- TODO: tbc -->

I've spent some days doing the whole memo thing and solving the cube with eyes open as I would with my eyes closed, after feeling confident enough I started doing some blind edge-only and corner-only solves. Partly successful. But boosting my confidence even more. For me it did not matter if 2 or 3 pieces were unsolved when I finished&mdash;to me this was a success already.

If you want to follow along, this is the scramble: `F L2 U2 L' D2 B2 L' F2 D2 R2 D2 B' L2 U' R F D' R2 D Rw2 Uw'`

That's it. I'm happy and satisfied. For now. See you when it is time to break my personal best time :P

Notes:

- Now had to learn memo technique from pochmann
- Spend 1 day solving only edge scrambles
- Spend another day only solving corners
- Many DNF
- After 4 days did it

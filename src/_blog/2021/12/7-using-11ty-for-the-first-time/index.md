excerpt: The everlasting battle of redesigning my personal website is getting really out of hand. Over the past few years I tried a lot of different approaches but none of them seemed to workâ€”until now

I think one of the earliest versions of my website was back in 2009, that's already over 10 years ago. Holy... Since then a lot has changed and I have redesigned this page countless times. So many different designs, blog posts, tools and systems that I have used, it's crazy. One thing that never changed was the domain though&mdash;[myxotod.de](http://myxotod.de).

For a long time I have used [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) as a static website creation tool or even built my sites bare bones without any other tools except SASS and maybe Coffeescript. Now, for the first time, I'm using [11ty](https://11ty.dev) and it is super fun to play around with. Well actually it is not *really* the first time using 11ty but at least it is the first use of it that you can actually see. This page has also countless ancestors before I got to this layout.

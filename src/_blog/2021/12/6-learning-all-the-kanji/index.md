For the first time, since learning Japanese, I have spent a conciderable amount of time to study kanji. Especially recognition and writing. So far I'm mostly testing and using the app [Japanese Kanji Study](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mindtwisted.kanjistudy&hl=de&gl=US) by Chase Colburn. It is a superb tool for studying so far, here is a list of kanji that I learned to recognize and write within about one week:

<p class="jp jp--vertical">
    一ニ三四五<br />
    六七ハ九十<br />
    百千上下左<br />
    右中大小月<br />
    日年早木林<br />
    山川土空田<br />
    天生花草虫<br />
    犬人名女男<br />
    子目耳口手<br />
    足見音力気
</p>

Before using this app I was only able to recognize a few easy kanji that I stumbled upon in my text books like <span class="jp">私[わたし]</span> and in terms of writing... I was not able to. Being able to write a set of kanji with correct stroke order and knowing the meaning and maybe even reading feels absolutely amazing. I can't wait to study more and get even better.

When I started using this app I set the "study type" to "Japanese school grade levels" which delivers new kanji in a similar order how schools in Japan would introduce them to their students. I thought this would be a good way to start but since I also want to pass JLPT tests along the way I switched the setting to "JLPT levels", which then started introducing relevant kanji for JLPT N5.

This is no sponsored post, I genuinely like the app and can recommend it to all people studying Japanese/kanjis. So far I'm happy with the progress I made and I excited where I will be in about one year using this and many other apps/tools. I'll keep you updated.

This is it. 50 Kanji I recently learned. I can't recall all of them yet, especially not the different readings but at least I can recognize the meaning. Big steps. Until now I was really afraid of learning Kanji because it is basically the biggest step in the Japanese language. No problem so far with simply and often used Kanji like 私 or 名前 or 元気 but if you know that there are still thousands of them waiting for you, you become a little stressed.

Luckily for me there are good systems, tools and apps out there to help me on my journey. Until now I didn't use any app or help to learn Kanji. I just picked them up on the fly. Whenever one popped up in a word or sentence I tried to remember it. Some I use often so it was easy, some I used very rarely so I usually forgot them by next use.

About a week ago I started using an app called "[Kanji Study](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mindtwisted.kanjistudy&hl=de&gl=US)". I had this installed since the very beginning of learning Japanese but never actually used it, like a lot of other tool apps for Japanese. Now I was reminded by [マックス](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCTcsUriABcZ1I5pbA38x30A), no not me, a German youtuber also learning Japanese. He tried Kanji Study in one of his videos and I thought why not give it another try too. Since I installed it a lot has happened and I improved. Now this app is way more powerful then before to me. I can understand a lot more.
